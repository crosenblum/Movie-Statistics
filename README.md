# Movie Statistics

This is a variety of batch files and other programs to help analyse and provide reports on movies inside folders

I am using batch file, although at some point I might be making bash script versions or use other languages.

This will be a multiple step process, to help me and others manage their video libraries in different ways.

Phase One - Get Year Statistics. How many videos were made and by which decade, so I can see a summary by decade.


## Features

- Gathers all year data for each movie
- Provides summary grouped by decade
